# The localo project

This is a Python module that wraps standard Linux cryptografic tools to create and manage encrypted volumes and their keys. Using cryptsetup can be a tedious job as the commands are intrincate and you have to do it with a lot of care of doing it the right way because one mistake can result in the loss o secrecy or worst with the irrevocable loss of information.

This project is in its alpha stage so use it with care.
